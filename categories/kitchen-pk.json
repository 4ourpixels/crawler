Fitted in narrow 150-mm units, it lets you hang your towels out of sight and can also be used to store cleaning materials or dishwasher tablets. With its thin-walled shelves, Snello makes full use of the available space. It also provides a good overview of the contents and access from both sides. The shelf at the bottom has a closed base to prevent small items from falling through, and both the shelf and plastic container are easy to remove for cleaning, after which they can simply be clipped back into place.",

Natursteinblöcke mit ihren wilden, von der Natur gegebenen rauen Strukturen und sanfte handgearbeitete Oberflächen erzeugen spannende, sichtbare und spürbare Erfahrungen. Im Kontrast zum Stein steht der Rohstahl in der vertikalen Konstruktion, gekennzeichnet durch ausgesuchte Zunderoberflächen und exakte Verarbeitung. Die funktionelle Ausstattung orientiert sich an professionellen Ansprüchen und vereint Qualität mit der Leidenschaft fürs Kochen unter freiem Himmel. Die Gartenküche – ein Objekt für alle Sinne.Die MKA01-Serie vereint eine lebendige Kombination verschiedener Materialien. Das Hauptaugenmerk liegt natürlich auf dem Stein: Münsinger Kernstein aus Franken, entstanden vor ca. 250 Millionen Jahren durch die Ablagerung und Verfestigung von Muscheln, Schneckengehäusen und Pflanzenrelikten. Der Nuancenreichtum in Farbe und Struktur geben dem Stein seinen einzigartigen Charakter für anspruchsvolle Gestaltung. Eine Besonderheit dieser selten vorkommenden Steinscheiben ist die Naturkruste. Schon beim Abbau der über drei Meter langen Rohblöcke wird der Erhalt der markanten Blockseiten berücksichtigt. Das detaillierte Bearbeiten und das Achten auf die natürliche Eigenständigkeit des Steines macht jede Küche aus der MKA01-Serie zu einem Unikat. Zwei filigrane Stahlwangen tragen den Steinblock der Küchenplatte und bringen die Erscheinung der MKA01 stilsicher auf den Punkt. Feine Materialkontraste, wie bei den Schubladen und dem Schneidebrett aus Eichenholz, setzen stimmige Akzente.Die Manufakturserie besteht aus 5 verschiedene Grundgrößen, die in Ihrer Ausstattung variiert werden können. Alle Varianten setzen sich gleichermaßen aus einer ca. 23 cm starken Natursteinscheibe aus Münsinger Kernstein, Wangen aus Stahl und einer Arbeitshöhe von 92 cm zusammen. Um jede Küche auf individuelle Wünsche anzupassen, kann man zwischen zwei Längen — 300 cm, 200 cm – und drei verschiedenen Tiefen – 120 cm, 90 cm, 75 cm – wählen. Die verschiedenen Größen ermöglichen 17 eigenständige Zusammenstellungen der verschiedenen Funktionsmodule. Natürlich gehen wir auch auf Ihre ganz individuellen Wünsche ein.",

Here, both horizontal and vertical grains are available. The solid wood fronts are produced with a material thickness of just 13 mm using an unparalleled technique. The front material is made up of several layers. In accordance with the stabilizing layer principle, three solid wooden layers are combined with two fine aluminum plates. The narrow thickness of the solid wood and fine aluminum strips become visible at the edge and create an interesting effect.",
